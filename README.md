# MMM-ProfileControl #
This module is based on the MMM-page-indicator (https://github.com/edward-shen/MMM-page-indicator) so first of all a big thanks to  edward-shen.

The aim of this module is to provide a possibility to organize profiles into horizontal areas (like pages) and vertical ones (i.e. to set an profile within MMM-CalenderExt).
It is possible to set the current vertical index or horizontal index by notifications. Additionally you can only decrement or increment these values with notifications.
